```{r}
#set the matrix
AEDs <- matrix(c(22,14,30,600,100,
                 16,20,24,625,120,
                 80,60,70,"-","-"),ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(AEDs) <- c("Warehouse1", "Warehouse2", "Warehouse3","Production cost","Production Capacity")
rownames(AEDs) <- c("Plant A", "Plant B", "Monthly Demand")
AEDs <- as.table(AEDs)
AEDs
```

Objective Function:

The  transportation problem can be formulated in the LP format as :
$$\text{Miminize} \hspace{.2cm} TC = 622 x_{A1} + 614 x_{A2} + 630 x_{A3} + 641 x_{B1} + 645 x_{B2} + 649 x_{B3}  $$
Subject to:

Supply constraints

$$  x_{A1} + x_{A2} + x_{A3}  \le 100 $$ 

$$  x_{B1} + x_{B2} + x_{B3} \le 120 $$
Demand Constraints:

$$  x_{A1} + x_{B1} \ge 80 $$ 
$$  x_{A2} + x_{B2} \ge 60 $$ 
$$  x_{A3} + x_{B3} \ge 70 $$ 

Non-negativity of the variables:

$$  x_{ij} \ge 0 $$ 

$$ Xij $$- where denotes the num of AEDs shipped from plant i to warehouse j.
$$ i = A,B   $$
and
$$  j =1,2,3 $$
I have used R programming language to solve the above transpiration cost minimization problem. 
This transportation problem is unbalanced one (demand is not equal to supply), that is demand is less than supply by 10,
so I create a dummy variable in column 4 with transportation cost zero and demand 10.
 
```{r}
#Set up AEDs_Costs matrix
AEDs_Costs <- matrix(c(622,614,630,0,
                       641,645,649,0),ncol = 4,byrow=TRUE)
## Set the names of the rows (constraints) and columns (decision variables)
colnames(AEDs_Costs) <- c("Warehouse1", "Warehouse2", "Warehouse3","Dummy")
rownames(AEDs_Costs) <- c("Plant A", "Plant B")
AEDs_Costs
```
 
```{r}
#setting up constraint signs and right-hand sides(supply side)

row.signs <- rep("<=",2)
row.rhs <- c(100,120)
#Supply function cannot be greater than the specified units
#Demand side constraints
col.signs <- rep(">=",4)
col.rhs <- c(80,60,70,10)
#Demand function can be greater than the specified units
```

```{r}
#solve the model
lptrans <- lp.transport(AEDs_Costs, "min", row.signs, row.rhs, col.signs, col.rhs)
```
Following that, we will return the decision variable values to determine how many units should be produced and transported from each plant.
```{r}
## Get the optimum decision variables (6)values
lptrans$solution
```
Plant A Units Shipped to Warehouse 1: 0 units 
Plant A Units Shipped to Warehouse 2: 60 units 
Plant A Units Shipped to Warehouse 3: 40 units 
Plant B Units Shipped to Warehouse 1: 80 units 
Plant B Units Shipped to Warehouse 2: 0 units
Plant B Units Shipped to Warehouse 3: 30 units
and  “10” shows up in the 4th variable it is a “throw-away variable”(dummy).

The function below will give the minimum value for the objective function

```{r}
lptrans$objval
```
Based on the information and limits provided, the minimum combined shipping and production expenses will be 132,790 USD..
```{r}
lptrans$duals
```

#2)Formulating the dual of the transportation problem

In primal, the number of variables equals the number of constants in dual. First, we must discover the LP's primal . We will take the minimization from the primal and maximize it in the dual. With the variables m and n, the dual issue can be solved.

```{r}
AEDs_2 <- matrix(c(622,614,630,100,"m1",
641,645,649,120,"m2",
80,60,70,220,"-",
"n1","n2","n3","-","-"),ncol=5,nrow=4,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(AEDs_2) <- c("Warehouse1","Warehouse2","Warehouse3","Production Capacity","Supply (Dual)")
rownames(AEDs_2) <- c("PlantA","PlantB","Monthly Demand","Demand (Dual)")
AEDs_2 <- as.table(AEDs_2)
AEDs_2
```

$$  \text{Max} \hspace{.2cm} Z = 100 m_{1} + 120 m_{2} +80 n_{1} + 60 n_{2} + 70 n_{3}$$


Subject to the following constraints

$$  m_{1} + n_{1} \le 622 $$ 
$$  m_{1} + n_{2} \le 614 $$ 
$$  m_{1} + n_{3} \le 630 $$ 
$$  m_{2} + n_{1} \le 641 $$ 

$$  m_{2} + n_{2} \le 645 $$ 
$$  m_{2} + n_{3} \le 649 $$ 
  
Where
n1 = Warehouse_1

n2 = Warehouse_2

n3 = Warehouse_3

m1 = Plant_1

m2 = Plant_2

These constants are provided by the transposed matrix of the Primal of Linear Programming function. You can double-check your work by transposing f.con into the matrix and comparing it to the constants listed above. where $$ m k, n l $$ where m = 1,2 and n = 1,2,3

#Objective function
f.obj <- c(100,120,80,60,70)
#transposed from the constraints matrix in the primal
f.con <- matrix(c(1,0,1,0,0,
                  1,0,0,1,0,
                  1,0,0,0,1,
                  0,1,1,0,0,
                  0,1,0,1,0,
                  0,1,0,0,1), nrow = 6, byrow = TRUE)
f.dir <- c("<=",
           "<=",
           "<=",
           "<=",
           "<=",
           "<=")
f.rhs <- c(622,614,630,641,645,649)
lp("max",f.obj,f.con,f.dir,f.rhs)
lp("max",f.obj,f.con,f.dir,f.rhs)$solution

So Z=139,120 dollars and variables are: $$ m_{1} = 614 $$which represents Plant A
 $$ m_{2} = 633 $$which represents Plant B
$$ n_{1} = 8 $$ which represents Warehouse 1
 $$ n_{3} = 16 $$which represents Warehouse 3
```


3) Economic Interpretation of the dual

Based on the information and limits provided, the maximum combined shipping and production costs will be 139,120 dollars.
There is a minimum value of Z=132790 (Primal) and a maximum value of Z=139120 (Dual).
The goal of this challenge is to discover a maximum and a minimum.
As a result, we realized that we shouldn't ship from Plant(A/B) to all three warehouses at the same time. We should be able to ship from:

$$60 x_{12}$$ which is 60 Units from Plant A to Warehouse 2.

$$40 x_{13}$$ which is 40 Units from Plant A to Warehouse 3.
$$80 x_{21}$$which is 80 Units from Plant B to Warehouse 1.
$$30 x_{23}$$ which is 30 Units from Plant B to Warehouse 3.
We will Max the profit from each distribution to the respective capacity.

We have the following:

$$  m_{1} ^0 -n_{1} ^0 \le 622 $$ then we subtract $$  n_{1} ^0 $$ to the other side to get  $$ m_{1} ^0\le 622 - n_{1} ^0 $$

To compute it would be $614 <= (-8+622) which is correct. we would continue to evaluate these equations:
$$  m_{1}\le 622 - n_{1} => 614\le622 - 8 = 614=>correct$$
$$  m_{1}\le 614 - n_{2} => 614\le614 - 0 = 614=>correct$$
$$  m_{1}\le 630 - n_{3} => 614\le630 - 16 = 614=>correct$$
$$  m_{2}\le 641 - n_{1} => 633\le614 - 8 = 633=>correct$$
$$  m_{2}\le 645 - n_{2} => 633\le645 - 0 = 645=> Incorrect$$
$$  m_{2}\le 649 - n_{3} => 633\le649 - 16 = 633=>correct$$

Using the Duality-and-Sensitivity, we may test for the shadow price by updating each of the columns. In our LP Transportation problem, we modify 100 to 101 and 120 to 121. R. can be seen here.

```{r}
row.rhs1 <- c(101,120)
row.signs1 <- rep("<=",2)
col.rhs1 <- c(80,60,70,10)
col.signs1 <- rep(">=",4)
row.rhs2 <- c(100,121)
row.signs2 <- rep("<=",2)
col.rhs2 <- c(80,60,70,10)
col.signs2 <- rep(">=",4)

lp.transport(AEDs_Costs,"min",row.signs,row.rhs,col.signs,col.rhs)
lp.transport(AEDs_Costs,"min",row.signs1,row.rhs1,col.signs1,col.rhs1)
lp.transport(AEDs_Costs,"min",row.signs2,row.rhs2,col.signs2,col.rhs2)

```


From the dual variable $$ n_{2}$$ where Marginal Revenue <= Marginal Cost. The equation was $$  m_{2}\le 645 - n_{2} => 633\le645 - 0 = 645=> Incorrect$$ and this was found by using $$  m_{1} ^0 - n_{1} ^0 \le 622 $$ then we subtract $$  n_{1} ^0 $$ to the other side to get  $$ m_{1} ^0\le 622 - n_{1} ^0 $$

```{r}
lp("max", f.obj,f.con, f.dir,f.rhs)$solution

```


$$n_{2}=0$$ .

The interpretation from above:
from the primal:
 $$60x_{12}$$which is 60 Units from Plant A to Warehouse 2.
 $$40x_{13}$$which is 40 Units from Plant A to Warehouse 3.
 $$80x_{21}$$which is 80 Units from Plant B to Warehouse 1.
 $$30x_{23}$$which is 60 Units from Plant B to Warehouse 3.
 
Due to the dual.Our goal is to get MR=MC.

MR=MC in five of the six examples.

Only Plant B to Warehouse 2 do not meet this criteria.

We can see from the primal that no AED gadgets will be transported there.
